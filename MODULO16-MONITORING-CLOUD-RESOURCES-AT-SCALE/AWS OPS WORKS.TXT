A (relatively) niche service you should've also heard about (for the exam) is AWS OpsWorks.

AWS OpsWorks helps you automate operations via Puppet or Chef. Puppet and Chef are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configuration of your servers. You could describe Puppet and Chef as (non-AWS-created) alternatives to Systems Manager and some of its capabilities.

AWS OpsWorks can be a valuable server management & configuration service for companies / AWS customers who don't want to use (or can't use) Systems Manager.
